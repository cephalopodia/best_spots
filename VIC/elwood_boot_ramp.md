# Elwood Boat Ramp

As known as **North Rd, Brighton Boat Ramp**, it has been a good and unpopular spot for squid due to its difficulties.
The water is normally clear and shallow. Furthermore, the sea bed is flocked with sea cabbage and other soft-sea weed.
Beware, there are small rocks that would easily take away your valueable jigs.

There are 2 spots that are ideal to station, one is at the `rock edge to the South` and one is the `pier` that is next to
the boat ramp.

The pier is pretty small, it would only accomodate about 3 people. From my personal experience, it is
easier to retrieve the catch if you do not bring gaft or hand net at the pier as you could climb down the pier staircase
to grab the catch.

The rock edge is more spacious and more popular to some advanced anglers. It is recommended to be caution as rocks here
can be very slippery and high chance your jig would get snagged if you do not retrieve them fast.

Due to its very shallow nature, it is much harder than other spots, but the results can be rewarding, it has been
reported good size squids caught here whilst Middle Brighton Bath pier yields nothing or much smaller in size.
Shallow and supper shallow jigs (from 5sec to 10sec/meter) are recommended here. Practice timing is critical for
success rate and to avoid being snagged. There are big guys at the strike zone and they tend to love violent jerk.
Watch out for following squids as they could get very hungry to trail the jig all the way close to the shore.

If you are into finicky small size (just like those in Rosebud pier), you should set up super bright light, there
are reports of small squids attracted to lights near the pier. Those small squids tend to be timid and don't often
go for big jig, please use size 1.5 to 1.8 size jig.
